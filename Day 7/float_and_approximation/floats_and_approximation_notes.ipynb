    "# Lecture Notes: Floats and Approximation Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture focuses on two key topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Floating-point numbers (representation, precision, and challenges).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Approximation algorithms (use of guess-and-check and binary search techniques).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Floating-Point Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** A floating-point number is a way to represent real numbers in computers, using a fixed number of bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format:** Follows the IEEE 754 standard, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Sign bit (indicates positive or negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Exponent (scales the number).\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Mantissa (stores the precision of the number).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges with Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision Errors:** Not all real numbers can be precisely represented (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 â‰  0.3 due to rounding errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overflow and Underflow:** Extremely large or small numbers may exceed the representable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Pitfalls:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Avoid using equality comparisons with floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Always consider a tolerance when comparing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example of precision error\n",
    "\n",
    "print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)  # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Approximation Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Solve problems where finding an exact solution is computationally expensive or impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Guess and Check:** Make guesses and verify against a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Binary Search:** Narrow down the solution space by halving it repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Square Root Approximation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approximate the square root of 50 using guess and check\n",
    "\n",
    "target = 50\n",
    "\n",
    "guess = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "tolerance = 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "while abs(guess**2 - target) > tolerance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    guess += 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Approximate square root of {target}: {guess}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Search for Square Root:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Efficient square root approximation using binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "target = 50\n",
    "\n",
    "low = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "high = target\n",
    "\n",
    "tolerance = 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "while high - low > tolerance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    mid = (low + high) / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    if mid**2 < target:\n",
    "\n",
    "        low = mid\n",
    "\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "\n",
    "        high = mid\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\"Approximate square root of {target}: {(low + high) / 2}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Floating-point numbers enable representation of real numbers but come with limitations like precision errors and overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Approximation algorithms are essential for solving computationally expensive problems and are commonly applied in root finding, optimization, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exercise 1:** Write a function that checks if two floating-point numbers are approximately equal (considering a tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exercise 2:** Implement a binary search algorithm to find the cube root of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exercise 3:** Create a program that demonstrates the effect of precision errors by performing various floating-point operations.\n"
