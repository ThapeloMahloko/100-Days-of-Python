# 100 Days of Python: Project Overview

This repository documents my journey through the "100 Days of Python" challenge. Each folder represents a day or topic, containing code exercises, notes, and projects that build my Python skills step by step.

## Daily Folders
Each `Day X` or `DAY X` folder contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and sometimes supporting files (like images or PDFs) for that day's lessons and exercises.

## Topics Covered So Far
- Python basics and syntax
- Functions, loops, and conditionals
- Working with lists, dictionaries, and other data structures
- File I/O and modules
- Object-oriented programming
- Projects like calculators, games (e.g., Hangman, Blackjack), and more
- Jupyter notebooks for notes and interactive exercises
- Practice with algorithms and problem-solving

This README will be updated as I complete more days and add new topics or projects.
